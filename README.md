# CZC_gpu_scraper
Scraper for gpu prices from czc.cz

Simply start the script and it will output the prices for each gpu in "gpu_price-log.csv", each day a new record can be added.

# TODO:
- plotting, to visualize the prices over time
- improve the logging to be more memory efficient when larger files might come up
